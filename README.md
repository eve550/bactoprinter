## Enderscopy


### For a Raspberry Pi 4 with Debian Bookworm OS (Released 2024-07-04):
### Installation
Create an 'enderscope' virtual environment to work in:

```
cd ~
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages enderscope
source enderscope/bin/activate
pip install pyserial jupyter ipywidgets numpy matplotlib
jupyter notebook
```
Clone this repo and open the 'demo' notebook in JupyterLab. 

### Usage

```
cd ~
source enderscope/bin/activate
jupyter notebook
```

> Note : Pay attention to the kernel
> In VSCode, you have to change the kernel, it has to be in enderscope.
> If it doesn't exist, enter the following command in the terminal :
> ```
> enderscope/bin/python3 -m ipykernel install –user –name=enderscope
>```
>
> And in Jupyter Notebook, you also have to change the kernel for enderscope,
> Go in core -> change core


> Another problem you might encounter is that the panel with the interactive buttons for controlling the printer does not appear : 
> In VSCode, you can verify the addresses are different entering the following command in the terminal :
> ```which python```
> ```which jupyter```   
> And to solve the problem :   
> ```
> python -m pip install --force-reinstall jupyter
> ```
### For Windows
### Installation

pip installation

```
py -m ensurepip –upgrade
```
Create an 'enderscope' virtual environment to work in:

```
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages enderscope
.\enderscope\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install pyserial jupyter ipywidgets numpy matplotlib
jupyter notebook
```

> Note : Pay attention to the index of the ports[] list. 
 An error message may appear (List Index Out of Range).
  In this case, refer to "Finding the Device-Port Name Mapping" below.

### Finding the Device-Port Name Mapping
### To get a list of connected and powered-on devices : 
Enter the following command in the terminal: 
```
python -m serial.tools.list_ports
```


> Note : To find the specific port name of a single device
Power on/Connect a single device and execute the same line of code in the terminal.  
This will return the name of the connected and powered-on port only.
